Summary: Font and land polygons updated for Hydda stylesheet.
Flags: front


# New fonts and land polygons

The Hydda stylesheet is now using [Google Noto](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) to get rid of those pesky tofu [] characters that previously populated the map in eastern Asia (CJK).
We have also changed the land polygons so that no split lines no longer are visible. We hope this will make our map style even more popular.

Please report any issues on  [the stylesheet GitHub project page](https://github.com/karlwettin/carto-style-hydda).
